After you exercise with them you can easily modify the codes to test different implementations of the same circuit. You can use the provided testbenches to test if your new implementations work. Practice makes perfect!</p><p><br></p><p>1. "Can an encoder be created in a similar manner?"</p><p>The answer is yes but you need to use the formula y = log2(a) for the encoder. I answered to another student in the questions how to create a synthesizable function for log2(N). You can take the code from there.</p><p><br></p><p>2. Also, can this style not be used to create 4:16 decoder using two 3:8 decoders?</p><p>Of course yes, but if your design is quite complex, then you won't have time to develop modules with such granularity. You will write directly the code for the 4:16.</p>
