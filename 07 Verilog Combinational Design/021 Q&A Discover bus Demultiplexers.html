<p><strong>Why all output values are set to 0 before case statement?</strong></p><p>(thanks to Przemysław Szymański)</p><p><em>In this case we want to have floating output because if something will be connected to the demultiplexer how we could determine if proper value is 0 for selected line or maybe we are observing 0 because other output is selected? Do we need Z state in this case or just gate off the signal instead of drive with 0?</em></p><p><br></p><p>In the picture bellow with a 1-to-4 demultiplexer. We have here 1bit <strong>Din</strong> that needs to be driven on 4 possible outputs by using the <strong>a[1:0] </strong>select bus. The last line of the table says that if Din = 0 then we don't care about the value of a[1:0], we just make all the outputs 0. This translates to<strong> 0 is propagated correctly regardless of the a[1:0] value</strong>.</p><p>When <strong>Din == 1</strong> then our transfer function needs to pay attention that <strong>Din</strong> is propagated correctly only to the specific output pointed by a[1:0] while the other outputs are kept 0 (not to propagate a 1 to a unselected path).</p><p>This kind of circuit doesn't have any "floating outputs" as it is a simple circuit made from NOT and AND gates.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2023-01-29_11-49-15-1a0a92a0e0a8e4bfa990674cfef9394a.png"></figure><p>Now let's return to our course example. We have a similar transfer function as I presented above so the explanation is simple. Zeros are always correctly propagated, while only when we have a non-zero value we need to be sure that the value goes where SEL[1:0] is pointing. The Verilog code from the action time works correctly for FPGA/ASIC regardless of the synthesis tool.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2023-01-29_11-49-15-c556ebf6d5dc6edbddfdd0f3a3344893.png"></figure><p>If you really need the other outputs to be high Z then you could gate A, B, C, D with some tri-state buffers, but using another Verilog module or an always@ procedure. I recommend this if you want to get the best synthesis results.</p><p>If you don't have Z values mentioned explicitly for you demux output, then you don't need to model them.</p><p><br></p>
