The default value of N = 3 is replaced with ADDER_WIDTH = 10 in the testbench at compile time. I did this explicitly to show how a Verilog parameterizable module can be used. The same explanation is given in the video at min 1.45.</p><p><br></p><p>For the second question "can we just leave N without assigning a number in test code like just writing #(parameter N)?":</p><p>The parameters from the design are used at compile time and they are very important as they control the size of your circuit/buses/etc. You should never model / simulate circuits of unknown sizes. This could create a whole universe of hidden errors. You can comment line 30 from the testbench and see how the adder will use the default value of N = 3.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2023-01-29_13-04-13-234ab98b0bcb6495a6c98c906471e504.png"></figure>
