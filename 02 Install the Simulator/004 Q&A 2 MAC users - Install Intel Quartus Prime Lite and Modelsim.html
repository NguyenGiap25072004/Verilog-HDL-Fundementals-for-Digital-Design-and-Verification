<p><strong>How to install Modelsim for MAC users?</strong></p><p>(thanks to E GH)</p><p><br></p><p>The easiest way to solve this is to use the online tool <a href="https://edaplayground.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://edaplayground.com/.</a> You will select from the Tool&amp;Simulators pane Mentor Questa (a better Modelsim) and you can simulate in the browser all the code example from this course.</p><p><br></p><p>Intel provides Quartus installation kits only for Windows/Linux so if you want to install Quartus/Modelsim on your Mac you should use some virtual machine with Windows/Linux on it. You should find enough documentation/apps for Mac that successfully do this.</p><p><br></p><p>But, as I said, <a href="https://edaplayground.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://edaplayground.com/</a> should provide enough resources to simulate all the examples from this course.</p><p>I hope this helps. Please confirm that you managed to simulate the Verilog "Hello World" example.</p>
