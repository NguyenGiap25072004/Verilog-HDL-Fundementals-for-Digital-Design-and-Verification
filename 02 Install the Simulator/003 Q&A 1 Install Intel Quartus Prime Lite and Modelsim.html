<p><strong>The Udemy course refers to Modelsim which you no longer supported. How can I perform a simulation using the Lite edition?</strong> <strong>How can I pursue the course since Modelsim is no longer available?</strong></p><p>(thanks to Jack Birnbaum)</p><p><br></p><p>Please open <a href="https://fpgasoftware.intel.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://fpgasoftware.intel.com/</a> and analyze the download options.</p><p><br></p><p>If you select Quartus Prime Lite Edition v21.1 (March 2021) you can see that it contains:</p><p>1. Quartus Prime (includes Nios II EDS)</p><p>2. Questa - Intel FPGA Edition(includes Starter Edition)</p><p><br></p><p>If you select Quartus Prime Lite Edition v20.1.1 (November 2020) you can see that it contains:</p><p>1. Quartus Prime (includes Nios II EDS)</p><p>2. ModelSim-Intel FPGA Edition (includes Starter Edition)</p><p><br></p><p>Modelsim and Questasim are products from Mentor that have the same menus, windows and appearance the sole difference being : "Questa Sim offers high-performance and advanced debugging capabilities, while ModelSim PE is the entry-level simulator for hobbyists and students. Questa Sim is used in large multi-million gate designs, and is supported on Microsoft Windows and Linux, in 32-bit and 64-bit architectures"</p><p><br></p><p>So you have 2 solutions and you may choose whatever you like:</p><p>1. Download version v21.1 and use Questa in the same way we use Modelsim (they will look the same for you)</p><p>2. Download version v20.1.1 and use Modelsim as the course suggests.</p><p><br></p><p>Also all the projects can be simulated using an <strong>online simulator</strong> (also FREE)</p><p>https://edaplayground.com/</p><p>https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_verilog_online.php</p><p>https://www.jdoodle.com/execute-verilog-online/</p>
