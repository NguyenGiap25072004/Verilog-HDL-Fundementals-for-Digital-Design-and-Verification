<p>(thanks to Vishnu V S)</p><p><br></p><p>After mastering the fundamentals and you are able to transform from a digital circuit schematic to a Verilog code, and vice-versa, <strong>the answer is YES</strong>.</p><p>You should be able to apply at least for an internship for Digital Design or Functional Verification based on Verilog. This course contains many industry-level best practices that are not emphasized / presented at academic level.</p><p><br></p><p>Also the proficiency in working with Modelsim is very useful to a job interview. Most industry simulators are similar with and you will become familiar with them easier at the job.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to do this I advise you to write all the Verilog code lines to gain experience writing code and simulate it using Modelsim. This will give you hands-on experience that you will use in more complex projects at your future job.</p><p><br></p><p>I also recommend to simulate and implement the practical FPGA examples from my YouTube channel:</p><p>https://youtu.be/QyfccW-v6mM</p>
