<p><strong>What about the vectors that are not all 0 or 1?? How does the NOT operator behave, please explain that. For example !1010 why is it 0?</strong></p><p>(thanks to Ofer Keren)</p><p><br></p><p>In Verilog we have 2 types of NOT operators:</p><p>1. <strong>logical NOT</strong>: uses the <strong>!</strong> operator</p><p>This operator returns a 1bit result which is either TRUE (1) or FALSE (0). The only case when the ! operator returns a 1 is for the !0 case otherwise it returns a 0 meaning that the value after the operator is non-zero. In your case !1010 = 0 because it has 2 bits of 1.</p><p>A very popular usage example for the operator is:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">if (!a)
// do something when a equals 0
else
// do something else when a is different than 0</pre><p><br></p><p>2. <strong>bit-wise NOT</strong>: uses the <strong>~</strong> operator</p><p>This operator can be applied to multi-bit and single-bit variables and returns a result that has the same width than the variable it is applied to.</p><p>A very popular usage example for this operator is to invert the values of all bits in a bus:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">a = 4'b1010;
b = ~a; // this means b = 4'b0101</pre><p><strong><br></strong>You will do extensive practice with both operators until the end of the course to know how / when to use them.</p>
