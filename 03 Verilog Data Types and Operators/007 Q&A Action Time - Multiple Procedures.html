<p><strong>Why do we create sim folder in action time folder?what is it necessity?</strong></p><p>(thanks to Raj Lahari)</p><p><br></p><p>We create another folder because Modelsim generates several files for each project. In this way we keep separate what Modelsim generates from our own Verilog files. </p><p><br></p><p>It is also an industry best-practice to have different folders inside a project and to group there files of the same type: </p><ul><li><p>1 folder for RTL where you keep the design files </p></li><li><p>1 folder for verification where you keep the tesbench and tests</p></li><li><p>1 folder for simulation, etc.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>The above structure may vary from project to project, company to company, but at the end of the day it is a way to keep your files organized and easy to find. This becomes critical when your project has thousands of files or even more.</p>
