<p><strong>How to monitor values of intermediate variables in the program using test bench?</strong></p><p>(thanks to Laxmikant Lokram Barde)</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to monitor the value of any variable inside a testbench you can do it in multiple modes. </p><p>Here are the easiest 3 ways:</p><p><br></p><p>1. Print it automatically in the console whenever that variable changes using the <strong>$monitor</strong> task inside the testbench:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">initial begin
    $monitor(" my_var = %b", my_var);
end</pre><p><br></p><p>2. Print it in the console during the procedural code execution using the <strong>$display</strong> task inside the testbench:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">initial begin
    sum = a + b;   
    $display(" a = %b, b= %b, sum = %b", a, b, sum);
end</pre><p><br></p><p>3. Observe it in the wave of the Modelsim simulator when a testbench is simulated.</p><p>To do this you need to start a simulation, then click on the instance name of the testbench fom the "sim" pane.</p><p>Next you will see all the testbench variables in the "Objects" pane. Select them all and the drag &amp; drop them in the Wave. After this you start the simulation and you will be able to inspect visually how each variable changes in time.</p><p><br></p><p>All methods are exercised extensively in our Action Time videos, so you will master them all.</p>
