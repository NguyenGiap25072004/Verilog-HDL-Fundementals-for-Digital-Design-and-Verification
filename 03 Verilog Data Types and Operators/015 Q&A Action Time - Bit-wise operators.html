<p><strong>How do I assign values to vector variables?</strong></p><p>(thanks to Naveen BALAKRISHNAN)</p><p><br><em>For example I have :</em></p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">reg [6:0] b = 0; // 7bit register
b = 7'b0; // Assigns all the 7bits to 0 BUT
b = 7'b1 // Assigns the LSB to 0 that is 000 0001</pre><p><em>Am I correct ?</em></p><p><br></p><p>You are completely right that 7'b1 has the value 1, so only the LSB is set. if you want to set all the bits you could do:</p><p>b = 7'b111_1111;</p><p>b = 2**3-1;</p><p>b = {7{1'b1}}; // replication operator</p><p>The easiest way to prevent a mistake is to use hexadecimal or decimal formats. b = 7'd1 means that Verilog has to assign the decimal value 1 to b. As you practice more, this kind of things will eventually become trivial.</p><p>I also attached a small exercise to see how b changes when different values are assigned.</p><p><br></p><figure><img height="521" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2023-01-29_11-15-35-f3882d87b6f220d984cd9f21bd4ba04c.png" width="338"></figure>
