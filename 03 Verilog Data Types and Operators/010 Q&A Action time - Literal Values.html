<p><strong>Why we used 8 bits since 137 is just 3 digits?</strong></p><p><em>As you said in literals , size is total no.of bits of the destination variable.</em></p><p>(thanks to Muddada Prasanth)</p><p><br></p><p>This example shows you what happens when your target variable is 8bit (left from = sign), and your source variable is 8bit with a non-binary representation (right from = sign).</p><p>I used the 8bit values to prove that the value 137(decimal) can be represented in different display formats (decimal, hex, binary, octal).</p><p>In hardware this is stored only as an 8bit collection of bits, but visually we can represent them in different formats.</p><p>8'd137 = 8'h89 = 8'b1000_1001 = 8'o211;</p><p>The 3 digits from 137 are a human friendly format that we use to understand the binary value 8'b1000_1001 that is stored in hardware.</p><p>These formats help us to easily understand the values used in computer systems, while the systems themselves always use the binary format.</p><p><br></p>
