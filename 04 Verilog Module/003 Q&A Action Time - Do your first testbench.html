<p><strong>Questions about the "initial" procedure</strong></p><p>(thanks to Sadhman Rahman)</p><p><em>1. Why is there 2 initial module blocks, what are the advantages of it?</em></p><p><em>2. If we use everything including "$monitor" in a single initial will it be a problem?</em></p><p><em>3.

Why is there 2 initial module blocks, what are the advantages of it?</strong></p><p>I use two initial blocks to get you used with multiple procedures and how they interact together. This helps you get used to work with code blocks that execute in parallel. Of course you can group anything in one initial procedure, but doing it like this will prepare you for more advanced examples.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. If we use everything including "$monitor" in a single initial will it be a problem?</strong></p><p>As I said above you can easily do it. Actually I recommend you doing so to observe the behavior. Please note that $monitor must be placed before starting your test scenario.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Can you refer me a book to follow along with the course?</strong></p><p>The course contains enough practical exercises so you won't need any book related to Verilog.</p><p>As an interesting read I would recommend "Digital Fundamentals 11th edition - Thomas L. Floyd". This book will help you build a very strong foundation on digital electronics. If you master these two you should have enough know-how to pass an entry-level interview for digital design/verification.</p><p><br></p>
