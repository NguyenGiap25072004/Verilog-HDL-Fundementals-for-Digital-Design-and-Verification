<p><strong>Is timescale needed for every testbench?</strong></p><p>(thanks to Minqing Liang)</p><p><br></p><p>The <strong>timescale </strong>directive is used to define exactly what 1 time unit is.</p><p>All the simulators have a default value for it, but it is recommended to be defined explicitly in all testbenches, mainly where you create clock signals that have a specific frequency.</p><p>At least for this course, you only copy/paste it from one testbench to another so it should be extremely simple to use.</p>
