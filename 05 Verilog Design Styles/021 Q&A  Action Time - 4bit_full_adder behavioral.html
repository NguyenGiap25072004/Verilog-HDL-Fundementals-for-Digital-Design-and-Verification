<p><strong>Isn't the modelling style in lecture 64 a data flow one? </strong></p><p>(thanks to Laxmikant Lokram Barde)</p><p>Although the code uses a continuous assignment, in the right hand side (RHS) we have a behavioral expression for our circuit instead of a logic gates expression as the data flow requires.</p><p><code>assign {carry_out, sum} = a + b + carry_in;</code></p><p>That's why I considered this code to be classified as behavioral. a+b doesn't specify how the adder will be implemented with logic gates, so it is a behavioral description of a circuit. </p>
