<p><strong>Why using different clock edge triggered flip-flop, could you explain it a bit?</strong></p><p>(thanks to Minqing Liang)</p><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2023-01-29_11-22-43-53d369faf401ec0309d94be09268d0e2.png"></figure><p>Here are some extra clarifications that should complete the Verilog Clock Divider by 3 tutorial from minute 1:09 - 2:10.</p><p>clk_in period: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</p><p>qa value: 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0</p><p>qb value: 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1</p><p><br></p><p>Both <strong>qa </strong>and <strong>qb </strong>have a frequency 3x slower than <strong>clock_in</strong>, but the duty cycle is 1/3 because the each pulse stays set only for 1 out the 3 clock_in periods.</p><p>The FF from <strong>qc </strong>has the role of creating the final signal signal clock_out with a<strong> 50% duty cycle</strong>. The <strong>qc </strong>Flip flop uses the <strong>negedge </strong>to sample <strong>qb </strong>because in this way it creates a delay of the <strong>qb </strong>value by<strong> half a clock cycle</strong> (qa and qb have 1 clock delay between them because they work on the same clock_in edge).</p><p>Now we have <strong>qb </strong>that starts from a <strong>positive edge</strong> of the clock_in and is set 1 period, and <strong>qc </strong>that starts from a <strong>negative edge</strong> of the clock_in and lasts one period. If we overlap these two signals we will get a final signal that is set for 1.5 clocks and is cleared for 1.5 clocks thus obtaining a clock division by 3 with a duty cycle of 50%.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the functionality of the<strong> Clock divider by 3</strong> circuit.
