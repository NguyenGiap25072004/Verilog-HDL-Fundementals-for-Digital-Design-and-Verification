<p><strong>How come I got a negative number for the delay? I used $urandom and when it's 10, it gave me -1.</strong></p><p>(thanks to Minh)</p><p>I'll assume that your source code is the following:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">reg[1:0] delay;
delay = $urandom;</pre><p><br></p><p>$urandom returns an unsigned 32bit number and delay[1:0] is of reg type which is unsigned by default.</p><p><br></p><p>The sign in binary arithmetic in only a convention to interpret the MSB of a number as its sign. For example 0111 = 7 in unsigned arithmetic and 1111 = -1 in two's complement (signed arithmetic).</p><p><br></p><p>I think that your "negative delay" is actually only a Radix representation issue in the Wave of the Modelsim simulator.</p><p>After you start the simulation and open the Wave please right click over the name of the "delay" variable and select <strong>Radix -&gt; Unsigned</strong>. Next you should see you delay as positive number. The default of the Radix may be Decimal which has negative numbers also.</p>
