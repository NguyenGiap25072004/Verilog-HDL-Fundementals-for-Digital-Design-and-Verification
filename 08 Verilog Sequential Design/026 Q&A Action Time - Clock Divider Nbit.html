<p><strong>I'm having a little struggle to understand how does this divider actually looks like, meaning how many flip-flops are in this schematic and where does the counter connect to the flip-flops is there still a feedback loop? </strong></p><p><strong>Where does the counter connect (maybe an RTL will help, I cant figure out how to output an RTL)?</strong></p><p>(thanks to Omer Fifer)</p><p><br></p><p>Here is how the synthesis results looks like for the downloadable code.</p><p>The divide by 2 is only a D flip-flop that has the Q inverted and connected with D (it has that small bubble before D).</p><p><br></p><p>The counter has 4 bits and is composed from 4x D flip flops and an adder (similar with the drawing from the course). The 4bits counter outputs contain the input frequency divided by 2/4/8/16.</p><p>If you change the size of the parameter you can obtain a smaller or a bigger frequency divider.</p><figure><img height="302" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2023-01-29_13-33-05-3fbda0e0782ba65f318ecb6d40cd9e48.png" width="753"></figure><p>If you want to be able to synthesize this by yourself then you can follow this tutorial (remember to remove the testbench code as it is not synthesizable):</p><p><br></p><p>I hope this answers you question.
