<p><strong>Please explain how lines 57 &amp; 58 are running parallel</strong></p><p>(thanks to <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/sadhman-rahman-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sadhman Rahman</a>)</p><p><br></p><p><em>You said Line 57 &amp; 58 is running in parallel. But then you said if qa is set in clock cycle 'N' qb is set in 'N+1', isn't this statement against the term parallel. Cause in parallel run shouldn't both be set in 'N' clock cycle?</em></p><p><br></p><p>I created the second variant of the code exactly to emphasize this concept that you asked about.</p><p><br></p><p>When I said "if qa is set in clock cycle 'N' qb is set in 'N+1'" I was referring at the fact that the non-blocking operator "&lt;=" executes in parallel those two lines of code whenever a 'posedge clk' occurs.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever a posedge clock occurs then the following happens in parallel:</p><p>1. qa updates with the value from the right-hand side ~qa &amp; ~qb (Note the values of qa and qb before the posedge)</p><p>2. qb copies the value of qa that was exactly before the posedge (the old value of a)</p><p><br></p><p>This can be easily seen from the waveform also.</p><p>I hope this answer helps you. Please try to play a bit with the simulation to see what happens.</p>
